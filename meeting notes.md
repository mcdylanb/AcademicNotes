- Concerns:
	- focus on chunks 
		- rental request
		- invoice integration
	- end goal: invoice approval
	- when adding contract, we should have a system to update contracts
	- 
- Goal:
	- chase vantage data for end goal
	- possible issues :
		- we would need to study business class custom java class how key alliance turns into invoice
- Future Features:
	- workorder communication
		- if invoice is unpaid
- Facts:
	- Ameco chooses the lowest rate base on daily hourly weekly
	- rates changes depends on On Rent and Off Rent dates
	- John has a helper to understand the flat file ameco sends
	
- questions:
	- what happens if tool being rent on other site, would we transfer the tool to the site requesting the tool?
	- what happens when if on rent and contract price changes, do we use the price during the start of the rent or what final price after the rent
	- what info needed on an off rent
	- where can we get extra info like taxes and additional fees
- Current Status:
	- lot of black box
	- need more info what to send vantage

TODO:
- Study how does key alliance work
- create Tracker of request/requirements
- compare contract, our tool list and billing list
- benefits of on line
- or custom application

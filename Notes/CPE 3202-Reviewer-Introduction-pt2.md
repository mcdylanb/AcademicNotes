Flash Cards:

Easy Category:
1. Q: What was ENIAC?
   A: World's first general-purpose electronic digital computer, created in 1946

2. Q: What replaced vacuum tubes in second-generation computers?
   A: Transistors

3. Q: Who is considered the father of the stored-program concept?
   A: John von Neumann

Medium Category:
1. Q: Explain the four basic functions a digital computer must perform.
   A: Data storage, data movement, data processing, and control functions

2. Q: What is Moore's Law about?
   A: The observation that the number of transistors on a chip doubles approximately every two years

3. Q: What are the key differences between application processors and dedicated processors?
   A: Application processors are general-purpose and support multiple functions, while dedicated processors are designed for specific, limited tasks

Hard Category:
1. Q: Describe the structure of the von Neumann machine architecture with its key components.
   A: Includes Main Memory, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit, and Input/Output systems

2. Q: Explain the evolution of integrated circuit complexity from SSI to ULSI.
   A: From Small Scale Integration (up to 100 devices) to Ultra Large Scale Integration (over 100 million devices on a single chip)

3. Q: Compare and contrast CISC and RISC architectures using the Intel x86 and ARM as examples.
   A: CISC (x86) has complex, feature-rich instruction sets, while RISC (ARM) uses simpler, more streamlined instruction sets optimized for efficiency

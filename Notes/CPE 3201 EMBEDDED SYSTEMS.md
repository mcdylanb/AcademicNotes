what the hell are [[VBAT (microprocessor)]]
what the fuck are [[analog references (AREF)]]

what are vdda 
whats the difference between 3.3v and 3.3va

- TIP: use global labels instead of connecting wires one by one

What the hell are [[NRST MPU]]
- reset chip
what the hell are boot0

what are vcap
and what are internal regulators
decoupled?
[[decoupling capacitors]]

what is left floating?

what does it mean run low?
what does it mean to pull pin high?

single pole double throw switch what the fuck is this
how to read disgn document?

what are HSE high speed external in?


introduction to embedded systems:
- Microcomputer concepts
	- CPU
	- Memory
	- I/O
- whats the difference between a microcomputer and a computer
- embedded system
	- computer system to do one or few task dedicated or specific functions often with real-time computing constraints
	- compared to a general purpose computer, embedded system has one specialize functionality 
	- the main processing core can be either microcontrollers MCU or digital signal processors DSP
	- Is a PC a embedded system
		- but apparently the PC contains multiple embedded system
		- like the system that performs fan control
	- Embedded Computer
		- is made up of multiple embedded systems
		- implemented for a particular purpose
	- 
- advantage of the PIC16F877A (40 pins)
	- locally available
	- the price isnt expensive compared to other microcontroller
- PIC16F84 -> good for practicing MCU 
	- 
- Applications of embedded computers
	- Automotive
		- BCM
		- GPS
		- ABS
	- Household
		- digital timer in microwave ovens
- Interface
	- general interface
	- despite having lcd and keypad, yet they are rarely capable of using many different types of input or output
	- example: entering password
- Reason why there arent great interface
	- limited pins
- IIC 
	- integrated Circuit
		- allow multiple use of microcontroller,
		- youll have to make them communicate to each other
- Real Time Systems
	- defined as a system whose correctness depends on the timeliness of its response
- Fitst recorded embedded system
	- apollo guidance computer
	- developed by charles stark draper at MIT instrumentation laboratory
- microcontroller vs microprocessor
	- i think microprocessor(uP) doesnt have built in memory and I/O compared to a microprocessor 
- Embedded system Solutions
	- ASIC & FPGA
		- contains complete system consisting of multiple processors, multipliers, caches and interfaces on a single chip
		- Soc - system on a chip
- Peripherals
	- serial communication interfaces
	- synchronous serial communication interface
	- universal serial bus
	- multi mdeia cards
	- networks
	- fieldbuses
	- discrete IO
	- analog to digial digital to analog
	- debugging
- Software Architecture
	- Interrupt 
	- Cooperative multitasking
	- 
- What are computing constraints
- What is the difference between embedded systems and embedded computers

Electric Current
- total charge that passes through some cross sectional area A per unit time
- cross sectional area -> represents a disk placed in a gas,plasma or liquid
[[MCU Interrupts]]
[[Timer0 Module]]
[[TIMERS]]
### hotkeys:
r to rotate


# Top Topics to understand
Peripherals
- General Input and Output (GPIO)
- Interrupts
	- function gets called when an event happens
- Timer
	- counts up or counts down
	- CCP capture compare 
- ADC Analog to Digital Converter
- Serial Interfaces
	- Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART)
		- requires two data lines

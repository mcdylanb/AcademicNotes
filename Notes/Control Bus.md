- The connections that carry control information between the CPU and other devices within theÂ computer is called Control Bus.
- The main objective of control bus is all signals controller carried from processor to other hardware device.
- The control bus transports orders and synchonisation signal coming from the control unit and travelling to all other hardware components
- The Control bus is bidirectional because the data can flow in either direction from CPU to memory(or input/output device) or from memory to the CPU.
- it also transmits response signals from the hardware.

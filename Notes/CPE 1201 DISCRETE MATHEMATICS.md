- declarative 
	- sentence that is either true or false, but not both
- Proposition
	- Declaritive sentance either True or False
- Propositional variables
	- represents propositions
	- just as letters are used to denote numerical variables
- What are truth value
	- truth value of proposition is true
	- denoted by T
	- 
- truth value of proposition is false
	- denoted by F
- Atomic propositions
- propositional calculus
- compound propositions
	- logical operators are used to create compound propositions
- What are negations
	- "it is not the case that p"
- What are negation operator
- Connectivs
- Logical Operators
	- Negation
		- opposite of the Proposition
	- Conjunction
		- is true when both $p and q$
		- ttt
		- tff
		- ftf
		- fff
	- Disjunction
		- example as OR
		- TTT
		- TFT
		- FTT
		- FFF
	- Exclusive OR
		- any true , true all
		- otherwise false
		- FTF
		- TFT
		- FTT
		- FFF
	- Conditional
		- read as f p then q
		- Cinverse , contrapositive and inverse

Converse
fliparo
example
the home team wins whenever it rains
answer:
if its raining then the home team wins

Contrapositive
false q -> false p
answer:
If the home team does not win, then it is not raining

inverse

Conditional Statement and the Hypothesis

Equivalent:
- When two compound propositions always have the same truth values, regardless of the truth values of its propositional variables

- Biconditional
	- read as if and only if q
	- 
- Whats the difference between conditional
self notes:
first chapter discuss more about identifying truth or in terms proof


# SETS:
Close Interval
- [a,b]
- a to b including a and b
Open Interval
- (a,b)

- Note: that the order in which the elemnts of a set are listerd does not matter
- Showing that A is a Subset of B_ To show that _A_ ⊆ _B_, show that if _x_ belongs to _A_ then _x_ also

- belongs to _B_.

- _Showing that A is Not a Subset of B_ To show that _A_ ⊈ _B_, find a single _x_ ∈ _A_ such that _x_ ∉ _B_.

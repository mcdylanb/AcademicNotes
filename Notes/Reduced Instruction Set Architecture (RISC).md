- The main idea behind this is to simplify hardware by using an instruction set composed of a few basic steps for loading, evaluating, and storing operations just like a load command will load data, a store command will store the data.
### Characteristics of RISC
- Simpler instruction, hence simple instruction decoding.
- Instruction comes undersize of one word.
- Instruction takes a single clock cycle to get executed.
- More general-purpose registers.
- Simple Addressing Modes.
- Fewer Data types.
- A pipeline can be achieved.

### Advantages of RISC
- Simpler instructions: RISC processors use a smaller set of simple instructions, which makes them easier to decode and execute quickly. This results in faster processing times.
- Faster execution: Because RISC processors have a simpler instruction set, they can execute instructions faster than CISC processors.
- Lower power consumption: RISC processors consume less power than CISC processors, making them ideal for portable devices.

### Disadvantages of RISC
- More instructions required: RISC processors require more instructions to perform complex tasks than CISC processors.
- Increased memory usage: RISC processors require more memory to store the additional instructions needed to perform complex tasks.
- Higher cost: Developing and manufacturing RISC processors can be more expensive than CISC processors.

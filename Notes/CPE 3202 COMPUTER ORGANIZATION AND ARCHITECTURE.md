- Structure 
	- the way in which the components of the computer relate to each other
- Function
	- the operation of each individual component of the computer as part of the structure
- Single Processor computer: 4 main structural components
	- CPU
	- Main Memory
	- I/O
	- System Interconnection
		- provides communication among CPU, Main Memory and I/O
	4 major structural components of the cpu
		1. Control Unit
			1. sequencing logic
			2. control unit registers and decoders
			3. control memory
		2. ALU
			1. perform the computers data processing functions
		3. Registers
			1. internal storage to the cpu
		4. CPU Interconnection
			1. 
- 4 basic functions a computer can perform
	1. data movement
	2. control
	3. data processing
	4. data storage
- Architectural design issue
	- computer will have a multiply instruction
- organizational Design issue
- What are called digital computers
	- to refer needed components 
	- digirtal compputer
		- is a electronic machince that accepts digitize information according to internal 
		- relation of the operating system and processing unit
		- OS is always in the main memory
	
- and waht are [[opcode (computer)]]

### Vacuum Tubes
IAS SET of Registers:
- [[Memory Buffer Register (MBR)]]:
- [[Memory Address Register (MAR)]]:
- [[Instruction Register (IR)]]:
-  [[Instruction Buffer Register (IBR)]]:
- [[Program Counter (PC)]]
-  [[Accumulator (AC) and Multiply/Multiplier-Quotient (MQ)]]:


# Prerequisites 
Arithmetic 
Methods in performing subtraction operation
- ordinary arithmetic: direct method (Borrow)
- Computer Arithmetic: 
	- Radix complement
		- 10's complement
		- 2's complement -> invert bits + 1
		- 8's complement
		- 16's complement
	- Radix - 1 complement/Diminished Complement
		- 9's complement
		- 1's complements -> inversion of bits
		- 7's complements
		- 15's complements
- odien , adden

# Module 3: Control Unit
- depending if its an single core processor or multi core processor
- how many units are there in an 8086 architecture 
	- Execution Unit (EU)
		- instructions that have already been fetched by the BIU
	- Bus Interface Unit (BIU)
		- BIU fetches instructions, reads data from memory and I/O ports, writes data to memory and I/O ports
- what is the role of control unit
- What is CPU
	- controlling element of the computer system
	- contains the control unit
	- all the decision done by the computer system originated in the CPU
[[Control Unit (CU)]]

## Introduction to Tracs
TRACS
- is an 8-bit CISC computer system developed purely for learning purposes


Operands
- data to be operated
Opcode
- operation code

```
MOV AX, 5678H;
```

Big Endian


# Computer Buses
- dedicated bus vs shared bus
- finding the width of the address bus
- Control bus 
	- read write
- Bus Arbitration
- buses has
	- synchronous
		- with clock
	- asynchronous
		- no clock 
- processor will not do anything without clock
- modern 
	- point to point interconnection 
	- instead of previous "shared interconnection"
- INtels QuickPath Interconnect
- Computer System Architecture 
	- Morris Mano

Questions:
Why the f are we doing segment offset?
Why we segment to 16
Was there existing clock in 8086

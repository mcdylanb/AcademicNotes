- Structure 
	- the way in which the components of the computer relate to each other
- Function
	- the operation of each individual component of the computer as part of the structure
- Single Processor computer: 4 main structural components
	- CPU
	- Main Memory
	- I/O
	- System Interconnection
- 4 basic functions a computer can perform
	1. data movement
	2. control
	3. data processing
	4. data storage
- Architectural design issue
	- computer will have a multiply instruction
- organizational Design issue
